# **TinyUrl backend**


## Overview

TinyUrl is a URL shortening service just like Bitly.

From both website monthly (MLS & BDS):
- Traffic from short links: ~1M
- Post amount: 120-210
- Share-link-team size: 12 people <br />
  => Short link generated monthly: 210 * 12 = ~2520 <br />
  Redirect monthly: ~1M <br />
  => If short links only stored for 1 year DB limit should hold: 12 * 2520 * (1+365) = ~11M records
  (since each link have 1 record on table 'links' and 365 on 'logs')

For auditing (see amount of access) of each link, 3rd party analytic tools are used, 
a CronJob will crawl these data daily, this should reduce overhead for server 
since short links will be accessed by a big amount of traffic

Same reason of reducing overhead, redirects will be cached too
