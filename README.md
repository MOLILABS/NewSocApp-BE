# **MetaPlus backend**


## Overview

MetaPlus Backend is responsible for controlling the Meta+ Bot (worker) through API. 
Every 3 minutes (more or less depend on worker's setting) each worker will call to BE and check what action it should 
take next, either cancel current order, move to new order or keep going with the current one.

If Meta+ Backend's order limit is exceeded, it will try to share some orders back to Portal BE, there Portal will push 
shared orders to 3rd parties to handle those orders.
